🖥️ Operating System Simulation in C++
📌 Project Overview
This project is a simulation of a simplified operating system environment, developed as part of the CL-2006 Operating Systems course at FAST NUCES (Spring 2025). It provides a menu-driven interface with multiple utility programs running in a simulated kernel/user space.

🎯 Features Implemented
🧮 Calculator – Basic arithmetic operations

🎮 Tic Tac Toe – 2-player terminal game

⏰ Clock – Real-time digital clock display

📝 Notepad – Create and save text files

✅ To-Do List – Add, view, and delete tasks

📁 File Operations – Create, delete, and rename files

🎵 Music Player – Terminal beeps to simulate sound

📅 Calendar – Displays current month and date

🔢 Random Number Generator – Within custom range

📏 Unit Converter – Length, weight, and temperature conversion

⚙️ Technologies Used
C++

Linux system libraries: unistd.h, termios.h, sys/ioctl.h

Console manipulation (custom getch(), clear, delay functions)

🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
Low-level I/O operations in a Linux terminal

Designing menu-driven interactive applications

Simulating OS-level process handling and multitasking logic

Building modular and reusable components in C++
